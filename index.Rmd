## About
I'm an entomologist specializing in the evolution of twisted-wing insect parasites (Strepsiptera) for my PhD in Comparative Biology at the American Museum of Natural History. My work involves the genomics, host associations, and speciation of this enigmatic order.

This site essentially exists for me to practice my programmingâ€”in R, CSS, HTML, etc. and to keep a log of what I've been working on. I don't really know what I'm doing, but I'm having a good time. Occasionally the last part is a lie because learning how to code solo is frustrating sometimes.
